To run the code with standard conditions (MAGPIE, 500W, 50-50sccm N2-H2, 10mTorr) add all subdirectories of the MATLAB folder to path. Then run
>> GlobalModel

This is a MATLAB script which will initialise all standard variables, and leave you on the evaluation tab. GUI is not shown - if you want to show it use
>> Controller.Show('on')  % to make GUI visible
>> Controller.Show('off') % to make GUI invisible

Can then either run evaluation from GUI, or with 
>> [T,Y,R,E,M,Converged] = ...
   SolveBalanceEquations(Controller,RelTol,MaxStep,'Auto',ConvergenceTolerance);

T is evaluation times, Y is evaluation densities with Te in last position, R is final rate, E is final error, M is used to show the error over time, Converged is a boolean of whether the run worked.

N.b. to clean up, should run
>> close all hidden
after to close any hidden windows (i.e. the GUI if it isn't being shown)

Updates are stored via git
>> git log
to see changes

A single variable scan code is included as
>> Run_single_variable_scan
This will provide a basic interface in the terminal to set up a scan. Will save the density and Te results to file.
